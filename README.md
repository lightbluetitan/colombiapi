# ColombiAPI

The `ColombiAPI` package provides a unified interface to access open data from the **API-Colombia**, **World Bank API**, **Nager.Date API**, and the **REST Countries API**, with a focus on **Colombia**. It allows users to retrieve up-to-date or historical information on topics such as geographic locations, cultural attractions, economic indicators, demographic data, national holidays, and key country-level details.

In addition to API-access functions, the package includes a collection of curated datasets related to **Colombia**. These datasets cover a wide range of topics including air quality monitoring, education (public schools), business and holiday calendars, agricultural exports (coffee), regulatory information (cannabis licenses), climate data (Medellin rainfall), and urban development (Bogot√° shopping malls).
