Maintainer: Renzo Caceres Rossi <arenzocaceresrossi@gmail.com>
Description: Provides a comprehensive interface to access diverse public data about
    Colombia through multiple APIs and curated datasets. The package integrates
    four different APIs: 'API-Colombia' for Colombian-specific data including
    geography, culture, tourism, and government information; 'World Bank API' 
    for economic and demographic indicators; 'Nager.Date' for public holidays;
    and 'REST Countries API' for general country information. The package enables
    users to explore various aspects of Colombia such as geographic locations,
    cultural attractions, economic indicators, demographic data, and public
    holidays. Additionally, 'ColombiAPI' includes curated datasets covering
    Bogota air stations, business and holiday dates, public schools, Colombian
    coffee exports, cannabis licenses, Medellin rainfall, and malls in Bogota,
    making it a comprehensive tool for exploring Colombia's multifaceted data
    landscape. For more information on the APIs, see:
